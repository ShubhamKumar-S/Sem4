Compare the changes in the Git Repository.
Git can be thrilling and, at the same time, intimidating as well. Don't worry, we are here to make things easier for you. Today, we're exploring Git's 'git diff' command, which developers use on a daily basis.
1.     We will create a repository using “mkdir” command.

2.     Now we will utilize cd command to move to the repository we created.

3.     By using the touch command, we will add and modify a test file with name “testDiff.txt”.

4.     We need to add content to the "testDiff.txt" file, so we have passed the string "This is a Tech Guide for git diff" to the text file.

5.     "git init" command creates a blank Git repository - basically a .git directory.

6.     "git add testDiff.txt" command will add testDiff.txt to the staging area. This is the area where the files will be added in the next commit.

7.     In this step, we have committed our changes by using “git commit”. When calling git commit, it is required to include a message. The message should be a short description of the changes being committed. Through the option -am, you can add and create a message for the commit in one command.
8.     When we Execute this command, it will change the content of testDiff.txt file. Once this file is modified, then we can be able to see the difference and analyze the output.
       Now let's execute "git diff" command and analyze the results:
