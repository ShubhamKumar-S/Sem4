## About
Data analysis involves examining and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights and patterns, guiding industry decision-making processes. Algorithms, on the other hand, are systematic procedures designed to solve computational problems efficiently. Businesses and researchers can uncover hidden trends, predict future outcomes, and optimize processes by combining data analysis techniques with well-designed algorithms. This synergy enables the creation of powerful tools and technologies that drive innovation and address complex challenges in fields ranging from finance to healthcare. Ultimately, the integration of data analysis and algorithms facilitates informed decision-making and fosters advancements in various domains.
# [Experiment -1.1]{https://github.com/ShubhamKumar-S/Sem4/blob/DAA/Exp1}
# Experiment-1.2
*Aim:* Implementation of Quick Sort using Divide & Conquer Approach.<br>
*Logic:* Sort a given set of elements using the Quick Sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in the list to be sorted, and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.<br>

# Expriment - 1.3
*Aim:* Implement Strassen Matrix Multiplication using Divide & Conquer Approach.
*Logic:* The aim is to design a program, which generates two matrices with various dimensions and multiplies the two matrices usingstrassen's algorithm. In linear algebra, the Strassen algorithm, named after Volker Strassen, is an algorithm for matrix multiplication. It is faster than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm for large matrices, with a better asymptotic complexity.

# Expriment - 2.1
*Aim:* Find out the Minimum Cost Spanning Tree using Kruskal’s Algorithm with the help of the Greedy Approach.
*Logic:* Kruskal's algorithm: Kruskal’s algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree for a weighted connected graph G=(V,E) to get an acyclic sub graph with |V|-1 edges for which the sum of edge weights is the smallest.
