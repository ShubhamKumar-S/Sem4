# Exp -1:- Install Git and creating repository
Installing Git prompts you to select a text editor. If you donâ€™t have one, we strongly advise you to install prior to installing Git. Our roundup of the best text editors for coding may help you decide.

# Exp2- Creating branches with GitHub
Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository. You can then work on this new branch in isolation from changes that other people are making to the repository. A branch you create to build a feature is commonly referred to as a feature branch or topic branch. You can also use a branch to publish a GitHub Pages site. You must have write access to a repository to create a branch, open a pull request, or delete and restore branches in a pull request.

# Exp 1.3- To create and explore Pull request
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

Pull Requests are commonly used by teams and organizations collaborating using the Shared Repository Model, where everyone shares a single repository and topic branches are used to develop features and isolate changes. Many open source projects on Github use pull requests to manage changes from contributors as they are useful in providing a way to notify project maintainers about changes one has made and in initiating code review and general discussion about a set of changes before being merged into the main branch.

# Exp 2.1- Editing a file and committing changes on GitHub
Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch. Git assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash, that identifies:

The specific changes
When the changes were made
Who created the changes

# Exp 2.2- To Merge Pull Request and Update local repository on GitHub
First, you will need to create a local repository for your project. I will be using PowerShell for this tutorial, but you can use any other terminal available to you. However, you will need to use equivalent commands for creating folders and navigating the directory structure so that you understand how to merge in Git.
